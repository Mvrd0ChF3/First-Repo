Hello!
This repo is my first first repo as a Github user.
I'm currently learning C++ and am reading through a book about the language.
I'm following along with the activities in the book.

I decided to upload all of my plain text files onto this repo as a make them, 
that way i can review them when i'm away from my main computer.

If you stumbled onto this repo, just ignore it.
It's only for me and i'm not an experienced Github user so i don't know how to make it private.

Thank you!
